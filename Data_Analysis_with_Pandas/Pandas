We are going to use Nominatim() in the next video. Nominatim() currently has a bug. To fix this problem, whenever you see these lines in the next video:

from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
nom = Nominatim()
change them to these

from geopy.geocoders import ArcGIS
nom = ArcGIS()
The rest of the code remains the same.
