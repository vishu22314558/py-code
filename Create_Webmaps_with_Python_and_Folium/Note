In the next lecture I use this in the code:

tiles = "Mapbox Bright"

Please use this instead:

tiles = "Stamen Terrain"

Mapbox Bright and Stament Terrain are both types of basemaps, but Mapbox Bright doesn't work anymore. Stamen Terrain works great and you will see it creates a beautiful relief map.
