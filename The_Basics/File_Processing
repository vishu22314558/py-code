In this section you learned that:

You can read an existing file with Python:

with open("file.txt") as file:
    content = file.read()
You can create a new file with Python and write some text on it:

with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    content = file.write("Sample text")
You can append text to an existing file without overwriting it:

with open("file.txt", "a") as file:
    content = file.write("More sample text")
You can both append and read a file with:

with open("file.txt", "a+") as file:
    content = file.write("Even more sample text")
    file.seek(0)
    content = file.read()
